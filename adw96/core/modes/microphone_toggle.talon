# To toggle talon microphone on and off

# created by aegis for Amy on Oct 2 2023

# aegis: this approach has the benefit that you can press a key again to get talon back, rather than relaunching the program, and means that talon won't listen to the mic in the interim (edited) 

# key(f5): user.toggle_microphone()
key(ctrl-m): user.toggle_microphone()
